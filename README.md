A simple top-down survival shooter game using Pygame. 

I originally built this for my Computer Science class at West Nottingham Academy to teach programming with user input and graphics. Students were then tasked with altering the code to add their own "DLC". These included adding additional enemies, weapons, an ammo system, and health pickups. This is the final version where I combined all of the DLC's together.
